Redrock spec-z fitting tutorial: https://github.com/desihub/tutorials/blob/master/redrock/RedrockOutputs.ipynb. 

Similar to BOSS spec1d (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.7326.pdf), but the data is not downsampled (which would introduce 
additional covariance between wavelengths â€“ in addition to e.g. flux miscalibration).
