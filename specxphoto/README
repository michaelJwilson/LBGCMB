-- Patej & Eisenstein:
   6,594,677  galaxies for the photometry.
   14,555     square degrees

-- Spectroscopy:
   Further criterion: z > 0.6.

   This yields 205,367 galaxies, and we select a set of random points 10 times larger than this for the construction of the correlation function.
   We note that while this z > 0.6 data is fairly sparse, it is not a sample for which Ï„ < 0.08.

-- Photometry:
   The photometric sample used in this paper comes from SDSS DR9 (Ahn et al. 2012) imaging data and comprises 6,594,677 galaxies
   over 14,555 sq. degs. (see Law-Smith & Eisenstein (2017), https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.03933.pdf, for a detailed description of the 
   color cuts used to define this sample); we use a catalog of randoms five times larger than this to construct the correlation function.
