-- Optical images have typical depth of R ~ 27.5 as measured through a ∼ 3'' diameter aperture (3 sigma).
-- Candidates were selected to R = 25.5 to ensure a sample of galaxies amenable to spectroscopic followup.
-- We exclude all sources with R < 19 that are saturated in our images, all of which are stars.
-- Yield was 10013 candidates across 14 fiels, average density of 5 / arcmin2.
-- Combined BX and LBG samples con- stitute ∼ 25% of the total R and Ks-band counts to R = 25.5 and Ks(AB) = 24.4, respectively.
-- Similarly, of the 5452 LBG candidates, 1903 were targeted with 1492 successful redshifts.
-- For the BX sample, most of the contamination at bright magnitudes arises from foreground galaxies. 
   For the LBG sample, most of the contamination arises from stars.
-- Applying a bright magnitude limit of R = 23.5 will reduce the overall contamination 
   fractions of the BX and LBG samples to 9% and 3%, respectively.
-- The detection rate of such sources is ∼2.8% (similar to the rate found among UV-selected z ∼ 3 galaxies; Steidel et al. 2002), 
   but is a strong function of apparent magnitude where all but two of the objects with R < 22.0 and z > 1 are QSOs.
-- Success of measuring redshifts is primarily a function of the weather conditions (e.g., cirrus, seeing) at the time 
   of observation, with a 90% success rate in the best conditions.
-- How well the photometric selection function (completeness) reflects the underlying z distribution of all star-forming galaxies.

-- Expected rest-UV colors of a galaxy with a particular redshift and reddening are computed by assuming a Bruzual & Charlot (1996) 
   template galaxy with constant star formation for 1 Gyr and a Calzetti et al. (2000) extinction law.
-- Most UV-selected z ∼ 2 − 3 galaxies can be described by long duration (> 100 Myr) starbursts and the constant star formation model 
   described above should reproduce this behavior to the extent required by the simulations (e.g., Shapley et al. 2005). In particular, 
   the rest-UV colors of galaxies are essentially constant after 1e8 years of star formation, once the mix of O and B stars stabilizes.
-- Intrinsic rest-UV colors are randomly assigned to simulated galaxies that are then added to the images in increments of 200 galaxies at a time. 
   This ensures that the image including all added (simulated) galaxies has confusion statistics similar to the observed image, since this will affect 
   the photometric uncertainties and systematics due to blending.
-- Galaxies that are targeted by the BX criteria can be shifted out of the BX selection window due to Ly-a emission or absorption.
-- We have made the reasonable assumption that the SED K-correction is approximately zero for the average rest-UV SED of BX-selected 
   galaxies after a star formation age of 100 Myr for the typical reddening (E(B − V ) ∼ 0.15) of galaxies in our sample.
-- L_Ha [ergs/s] = 1.77e13 * L_1700 [ergs/s/Hz]
   The resulting Ha luminosities are then perturbed by 0.3 dex to account for the dispersion in the relation between the dust-corrected 
   UV and Ha estimates (Erb et al. 2006b).
