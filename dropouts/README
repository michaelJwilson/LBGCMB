-- Composite doesn't need madau.
-- what do they do for madau extinction and qsos in redrock.

-- Redrock estimates to date don't take into account degeneracies between LBG and low-z Balmer break looking like Lyman.
-- As per KG, need 25hr exposure to resolve absorption features such that the two can be distinguished.

-- Need a means to resample noise curve in wavelength/frequency.
